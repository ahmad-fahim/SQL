There is a report for the central bank of Balgladesh for Anti Money Laundering(AML). We had to provide the basic information of all the coutomer, accounts and transactions to a third party vendor on every weekend. We created a schedule on the production server to generate those data in few tables and after the data generation, we provided those data in a middleware server. The third party vendor takes those data from that server and processed those data to generate few reports related to Anti Money Laundering.
