Developers from the customer side developed a web interface which shows few visulizations of their assets and liabilities. For that application, they needed data from the CBS side. But they were not aware of the structure of the table structure. We were told to provide the data in an intermediate schema in the UAT server. Then we managed these objects in the UAT server whose generate data from the production server and store those data in the UAT server everyday. There is a cronjob in the UAT server which calls the f12_f42_data_process.sh file and generate the data. Developers from the customer side pulls data everyday and stored then in their side.
