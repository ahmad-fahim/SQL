Customers of the CBS didn't migrate the historical balances from the previous version of their branch banking. They just migrated the current balance from the legacy system. After coming in the CBS, they requested to generate a report from their old system for the last 5 years account balance as well as the general ladger balance. These scripts generate the temporary data for the trial balance, account balance and the statement of affairs of the bracnh for last 5 years from the date of migration.
