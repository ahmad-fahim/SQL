There are some cases when the balances of General Ladger updated wrongly for some manual update in the system or sometimes for network failure. Then we had to correct the balances quickly for the customers for that general ladger. There are 3 tables here for the general ladgers to be updated because balance for general ladgers are kept in those tables. We had to do this update manually by some correction in the scripts.
